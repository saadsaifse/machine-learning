# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a model to predict the unknown values of a linear input. Linear regression tries to find a straight line that passes as close as possible to all the data points.

You might have seen the equation of straight line in a 2D xy-plane `y = mx + c` where `m` is the slope of line and `c` is the offset from the origin. Linear regression model takes the same concept and tries to find the optimal `m` and `c` values from the available values of `x` such that a new value of `x` produces an appropriate predicted value.
