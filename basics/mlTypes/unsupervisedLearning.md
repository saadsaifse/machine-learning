# Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, inputs do not contain the correct responses i.e., labels. So the algorithm tries to find similarities in the input data and categories them based on the common information. This is similar to Density Estimation approach in statistics.

A few example of unsupervised learning can be:

* *outlier detection* where the model returns a real value which falls outside of the typical values of the dataset.

* *clustering* where the model clusters the dataset and returns an identification key based on the type of cluster.
