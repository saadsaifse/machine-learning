# Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, correct output is known to the model before hand. The training data contains inputs and their corresponding expected outputs so that the model learns what to expect or suggest based on new input data. The algorithm generalises to respond correctly to all possible inputs. This is also called learning from exemplars.

Todo: add some examples
