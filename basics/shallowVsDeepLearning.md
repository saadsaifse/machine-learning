# Shallow vs. Deep Learning

Ever wondered, what is deep learning? why do we call it *deep*? Is it because it contains multiple layers of neurons? or is it something else? 

Firstly there is no hard and fast rule regarding this. These are just terms that just stick to it but there are some points we can consider to at least try to put this concept into perspective.

Every ML model has its own parameters. The way a model builds these parameters can be divided. A model that takes its parameters directly from feature inputs can be categories in **Shallow Learning** category. Most supervised learning models such as SVM are examples of shallow learning. 

While the models that build up or deduce their parameters by more than just feature inputs can be classified as **Deep Learning** models. Such models contain multiple hidden layers that take values from the calculations of preceding layers. Hence forming a deep or hierarchical engine of computation.
