# Classification vs. Regression

Classification is a process of identifying an unlabeled item and assigning a label to it. The labels can be from among a set of classes or can be just yes or no, which is the case with binary classification. Spam detection of emails is a binary classifier that classifies emails as either 'Spam' or 'Not-Spam'. 

Regression on the other hand is a process of finding/predicting a real value by using the past data and available information. Predicting gold prices based on the labeled past data such as gold price in last month, last year, etc. is an example of regression. 

Regression is performed using regression learning algorithms that take labeled examples as inputs to build a model. The model is then used to predict regression value or target value from the unlabeled data.
