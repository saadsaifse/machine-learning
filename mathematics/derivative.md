# Derivative

Simply put, a derivative tells a rate of change of some function with respect to variables involved in the function. It tells how fast or slow the function values are changing. This implies that, if the functions only has constant values then its derivative is always zero.

One way to represent a derivative is to put a dash on top of function name. For example, the derivative of function *f* is represented by *f<sup>'</sup>*. If the result of derivative is a constant value i.e., 2 or -3, etc. then the function is increasing or decreasing with a constant rate. If the derivative produces another function then the original function has variable rate of change depending upon the input values. However, if the derivative is zero, then there is no change and the slope of function is horizontal.

* Derivative of *f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>* is *2x*
* Derivative of *f(x) = 2x* is *2*
* Derivative of *f(x) = 2* is *0*

## Partial Derivative

Derivative is alway taken with respect to some input variable which is in the function. How do we find derivate of functions that consist of several variables such as *f(x,y) = 2x + y<sup>2</sup>*. Here comes the partial derivative. A partial derivative is nothing but a derivative with respect to a single variable in the equation. In the above example function, we can take two partial derivative, one with respect to *x* and the other with respect to *y*. While taking derivate w.r.t one variable, all other variable terms can be considered zero as there is no change while changing the variable on which differentiation is being applied. 

Therefore, in function *f(x, y)* partial derivate w.r.t *x* would become *2* and w.r.t *y* would be *2y*
