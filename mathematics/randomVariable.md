# Random Variable

Random variable represents a random phenomenon and takes the random numerical outcomes of that phenomena. It is usually represented by an italic capital letter, such as *X*. 

Depending upon the nature of phenomenon, a random variable can either be discrete or continuous. A discrete random variable takes on only countable values, such as 1, 2, 3, ... or Monday, Tuesday, Friday, etc. Whereas a continuous random variable takes infinite number of values for example, time, temperature, elevation, etc. 

## Probability Distribution

Since there is random occurrence of values in a random variable, it makes sense to find out the probability for each value. The sum of all probabilities of a random variable is always 1. 

In case of discrete random variable, with discrete outcomes of 1, 2, and 3, we can say that Pr(*X* = 1) = 0.5, Pr(*X* = 2) = 0.35 and Pr(*X* = 3) = 0.15 and they all sum up to 1. Of course, these probabilities are calculated based on some parameters or factors that influence the outcome. 

### Probability Mass Function

The list of probabilities of all occurrences of a random variable is called *probability mass function* (pmf). Pmf has all values either 0 or greater than 0 but sum of all values is 1.

In case of continuous random variable, there are infinite values that have to sum up to 1, as the sum of probabilities have to be 1. In this case, the probability at any constant value *c* is always 0 i.e., Pr(*X* = *c*) = 0.

### Probability Density Function

Since the list of probabilities (pmf) in case of continuous random variable cannot be determined. We calculate the Probability Density Function (pdf). Pdf gives us a continuous curve whose areas under the curve is equal to 1.
